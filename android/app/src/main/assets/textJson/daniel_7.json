broke forth upon the great sea.", "3 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.", "4 The first was like a lion, and had eagles wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a mans heart was given to it.", "5 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.", "6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.", "7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.", "8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.", "9 I beheld  Till thrones were placed,  And one that was ancient of days did sit:  His raiment was as white snow,  And the hair of his head like pure wool;  His throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.", "10 A fiery stream issued  And came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him,  And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him;  The judgment was set,  And the books were opened.", "11 I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.", "12 And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.", "13 I saw in the night visions,  And, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven  One like unto a son of man,  And he came even to the Ancient of days,  And he was brought near before Him.", "14 And there was given him dominion,  And glory, and a kingdom,  That all the peoples, nations, and languages  Should serve him;  His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,  And his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.", "15 As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.", "16 I came near
